# Jekyll Blog Poster

This simple Python script will create a new blog post in your Jekyll `_posts/` directory. It will ask you for the title, description, your name and the tags. It will then create a new file with a name in the standard Jekyll YYYY-MM-DD-title.md format. Once the file is created, it will open it in your default editor.

# Usage
Place `py_post.py` in the root directory of your Jekyll blog, and then run `python py_post.py` in the terminal, or alternatively run `./new_post.sh`. Follow the instructions to create a new post.
