# pypost

This simple Python script will create a new blog post in your current working directory. It will ask you for the title, description, your name and the tags. It will then create a new file with a name in the standard Jekyll YYYY-MM-DD-title.md format. Once the file is created, it will open it in your default editor.

# Usage
Place `pypost.py` in the root directory of your Jekyll blog, and then run `./pypost` in the terminal. Follow the instructions to create a new post.

# Disclaimer
This program was made in GNU/Linux, and is not guaranteed to work on other operating systems. I have not tested this program in Windows, so use at your own risk.
